        <h1>Tom Kha</h1>
        <img src="../img/tomkha.jpg" alt="Bowl of Tom Kha Gai coconut soup with mushrooms, lime, and chicken floating on the surface">
          <h2>An authentically inspired Thai coconut soup</h2>
            <p>Bringing together traditional flavors like lemongrass,
                galengal, and makrut lime, this recipe balances the
                sweetness of coconut with the tang of these more 
                regional ingredients. The dish is often made with chicken
                as Tom Kha <em>gai</em> but can be made with tofu, shrimp, fish,
                or really whatever you prefer.
                <br>
                One of my all time favorite dishes! whether to order
                on a night out or trying a recipe at home, I've been 
                searching for the perfect Tom Kha recipe for many years.
                <br>
                Tom Kha directly translates to 'boiled galengal broth'
                but is so much more then that. The soup strikes a great
                balance between the rich and creamy to bright and tart.
                Tender chicken, flaverful mushrooms, and fresh cilantro 
                make this dish a star on all points. It's filling but I 
                always want more!

              <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium pot, heat the coconut oil over
                        medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, jalapeno
                        or chile, galangal or ginger, lemongrass, 
                        and red curry paste and cook, stirring frequently,
                        for 5 minutes, or until onions are softened. 
                        Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. 
                        Reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Strain out the aromatics (the garlic, onions, 
                        lemongrass, and ginger) and discard. 
                        Add in coconut cream or milk, chicken breast (or tofu or shrimp), and mushrooms. 
                        Simmer until chicken breast pieces are just cooked through, 
                        then add fish sauce, coconut aminos (or coconut sugar),
                        and lime juice, plus more of each to taste.</li>
                    <li>Cook 2 minutes, then ladle into serving bowls and
                         top with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro.</li>
                </ol>
              <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Be sure to use <strong>coconut cream or coconut milk.</strong> 
                        Coco lopez and coconut creamer are not the same as coconut cream/coconut milk 
                        and will not work in this recipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>To use shrimp,</strong> simply stir in 1 pound of raw shrimp instead of chicken. 
                        Simmer until just cooked through, pink, and no longer translucent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it Whole30:</strong> Use compliant chicken broth. Use 2 tablespoons coconut aminos
                         instead of coconut sugar. Use Red Boat fish sauce - this is the only fish sauce 
                         I've found to be compliant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Make it Vegan/Vegetarian:</strong> Use vegetable stock, preferably an Asian variety.
                         Use a 1-pound block of firm or extra firm tofu (regular or silken)
                          cut into bite-sized cubes. For vegan, use soy sauce (to taste) instead of fish sauce.</li>
                </ul>

        <h1>Cocktails: The Classic Old Fashioned</h1>
          <img src="../img/oldfash.jpg" alt="Old fashioned cocktail with an orange twist and skewered brandy cherries">
            <h2>The King of Cocktails</h2>
              <p>The old fashioned is the quintessential cocktail, 
                  hailing back to the very beginning of cocktail recipes and culture.
                  A simple blend of bourbon, sugar, and angostura bitters garnished
                  with an orange twist and punched up with a brandied cherry.</p>
                  <br>
              <p>The history of the Old Fashioned stradles the breadth of
                   cocktail culture with its history and scope of interpretation
                   over the years. From the austere liqour, sugar, and angostura bitters to 
                   the involved liqour infused with all manner of matter, aperatifs, sweetener blends, and secret bitter blends 
                   adorned with arrangements of dried, cured, and fresh fruits.</p>
                   <br>
              <p>The Old Fashioned is one of my favorite drinks for exactly this 
                   reason, it can be adapted for so many situations and cobbled together reliably
                   in the most dire of situations.</p>
